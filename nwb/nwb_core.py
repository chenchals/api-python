    <a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">Hierarchical Data Format (HDF)</a>
      was selected for the NWB format
      because it met several of the project's requirements. First, it is
      a mature data format standard with libraries available in multiple
      programming languages. Second, the format's hierarchical structure
      allows data to be grouped into logical self-documenting sections. Its
      structure is analogous to a file system in which its "groups" and
      "datasets" correspond to directories and files. Groups and
      datasets can have attributes that provide additional details, such as
      authorities' identifiers. Third, its linking feature enables data
      stored in one location to be transparently accessed from multiple
      locations in the hierarchy. The linked data can be external to the
      file. Fourth,
      <a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/">HDFView</a>,
      a free, cross-platform application, can be used to open a file and
      browse data. Finally, ensuring the ongoing accessibility of
      HDF-stored data is the mission of The HDF Group, the nonprofit that
      is the steward of the technology.</p>

      a schema file written in a specification language created for this
      project. The specification language describes the schema, including
      data types and associations. A new schema file will be published for
      each revision of the NWB format standard. Data publishers can use the
      specification language to extend the format in order to store types
      of data not managed by the base format.

        The data organization presented in this document constitutes the <i>core</i> NWB
        format.  Extensibility is handled by allowing users to store additional
        data as necessary using new datasets, attributes or groups.  There are
        two ways to document these additions.  The first is to add an attribute
        "neurodata_type" with value the string "Custom" to the additional groups
        or datasets, and provide documentation to describe the extra data if
        it is not clear from the context what the data represent.  This method
        is simple but does not include a consistant way to describe
        the additions.  The second method is to write an
        <i>extension</i> to the format.  With this method, the additions are
        describe by the extension and attribute "schema_id" is set to
      the schema_id associated with the extension.
      Extensions to the format are written
        using the same specification language that is used to define the
        core format.  Creating an extension allows adding the new data to the file
        through the API, validating files containing extra data, and also
        generating documentation for the additions.
        Popular extensions can be proposed
        and added to the official format specification.
        Writing and using extensions are described in the API documentation.
        Both methods allow extensibility without breaking backward compatibility.

Subfolders in 'general/' are only to be included as needed. Scanning
'general/' should provide the user a quick idea what the experiment
