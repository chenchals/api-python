function abstract_feature()
% Store the Salient Features of a Drifting Gratings Visual Stimulus
% 
% This example demonstrates how to use an AbstractFeatureSeries to store
% data that can be summarized by certain high-level features, such as the 
% salient features of a visual stimulus. The standard example of this is 
% for drifting gratings -- the spatial frequency, orientation, phase, 
% contrast and temporal frequency are the most important characteristics 
% for analysis using drifting gratings, not necessarily the stack of all 
% frames displayed by the graphics card.

% ("w-") does not overwrite an existing file.

% specify the start time of the experiment. all times in the NWB file
%   are relative to experiment start time
% if the start time is not specified the present time will be used

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% create an AbstractFeatureSeries
% this will be stored as a 'stimulus' in this example for this example. that
%   means that it will be stored in the following location in the hdf5
%   file: stimulus/presentation/

abs = f.make_group('<AbstractFeatureSeries>', 'my_drifting_grating_features', 'path', '/stimulus/presentation');
abs.set_attr('description', 'This is a simulated visual stimulus that presents a moving grating');

% an AbstractFeatureSeries is an instance of a TimeSeries, with addition
%   of the following fields:
%       features -- describes the abstract features
%       feature_units -- the units that these features are measured in
% define the abstract features that we're storing, as well as the units
%   of those features (any number of features can be specified)
features = { 'orientation', 'spatial frequency', 'phase', 'temporal frequency'};
units = { 'degrees', 'Hz', 'radians', 'degrees'};
% store them
abs.set_dataset('features', features);
abs.set_dataset('feature_units', units);

% specify the source of the abstract features.  All TimeSeries types should have a
% source, description and comments specified; otherwise a warning is generated.
abs.set_attr('source', 'Simulated data. Normally this would be the device presenting stimulus');

% create some pretend data
% data = np.arange(4000).reshape(1000, 4)
data = reshape(0:3999, [1000, 4]);

% add data to the time series. for now, ignore the last 3 parameters
% t = np.arange(1000) * 0.001
t = (0:999) * 0.001;
abs.set_dataset('data', data);
abs.set_dataset('timestamps', t);


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% it can sometimes be useful to import documenting data from a file
% in this case, we'll store this script in the metadata section of the
%   file, for a record of how the file was created
f.set_dataset('source_script', py.nwb.nwb_utils.load_file(script_name), ...
    'attrs', {'file_name', script_name});

% when all data is entered, close the file
f.close()
